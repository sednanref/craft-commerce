Shipping:

Shipping methods (which have conditions based in rules, i.e. shipping zone, costs, etc)

Shipping zones: to add into the shipping method's conditions.

PAYMENTS: 
 For payments you have to add a gateway in:

Commerce->SystemSettings->Gateways

There is a plugin for payment method's gateway called "Stripe"

* ORDERS Status

In order to change the order statuses, you must go to
Commerce->SystemSettings->OrderStatuses

Some examples:
	- processing
	- Fullfilled
	- Shipped
	- Exception

* Email setup to send success order or any other action in commerce

Commerce->SystemSettings->Emails

you can create emails with templates from there

and then in the panel control view for an order, you can send the emails.

make sure you have the correct email settings in 
Settings->email (in my case I used Gmail as transport type), to allow this you have to allow other "insecure" apps to have access to your google account, to do so go to you "manage google account"->security and activate it, it is recommended to use it only when testing this feature and then restrict the access to your google account once you are done!

To send based on certain actions:

Commerce->SystemSettings->OrderStatuses-><Some Status> -> StatusEmail and select! 

PROMOTIONS

Commerce -> promotions

You have:
	Discounts & Sales

Sales are promotions applied to products before they are added to the cart, Discounts are discounts depending on some actions like coupons!

TAXES:

There are 3 different types of configurable taxes in craft:

- Tax Rates
- Tax Categories
- Tax Zones: can be scoped on countries, states (US) or ZIP Codes.


==================
    PLUGINS
==================

* In order to create a new plugin, create a new folder plugins and inside of it create the plugin "craft-plugin-name"
'craft-' is only by convention, then you create the composer.json of the plugin and add it in the repositories of the
project's composer.json.
* then you can do `composer require <plugin-name>` (plugin name is sednanref/user-guide in this example)
* for the icons you just need an icon.svg and an icon-mask.svg in the src folder of your plugin.
