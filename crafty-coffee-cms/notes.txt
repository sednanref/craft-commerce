Some examples:
	- processing

* Email setup to send success order or any other action in commerce

Commerce->SystemSettings->Emails

you can create emails with templates from there

and then in the panel control view for an order, you can send the emails.

make sure you have the correct email settings in 
Settings->email (in my case I used Gmail as transport type), also you have to allow other "insecure" apps to have access to your account, to do so go to you "manage google account"->security and activate it.

To send based on certain actions:

Commerce->SystemSettings->OrderStatuses-><Some Status> -> StatusEmail and select!
